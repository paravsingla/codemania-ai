# Day 1
Today, we had a brief session about the introduction to artificial intelligence and worked with Python a little.



### Things To Do:

- Install Python 3 if you have not installed it already. You can follow this link here. [https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/python.html]
- Play around with the interactive python shell and write some programs including functions, and classes to get comfortable with the syntax.
- Go through the first few chapters of the book Beginning Python, uploaded here.
