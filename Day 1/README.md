# Day 1
Today, we had a brief session about the introduction to artificial intelligence and worked with Python a little.



### Things To Do:

- Install Python 3 if you have not installed it already. You can follow this link [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/python.html).
- Play around with the interactive python shell and write some programs including functions, and classes to get comfortable with the syntax.
- Go through the first few chapters of the book Beginning Python, uploaded [here](https://github.com/paravsingla/codemania-ai/blob/master/Day%201/Magnus%20Lie%20Hetland%20-%20Beginning%20Python_%20From%20Novice%20to%20Professional%20(2017%2C%20Apress).pdf).
